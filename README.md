# Movie Nights Roulette v0.07

## Join the roulette

Join the roulette! As a participant of the rotation, you have your own pool of movies to add to and pick from when it's your night to choose a movie.

### Adding a movie

You can add movies to your own pool at any time. A pick requires **three** fields:

1. Film title
2. Film duration (in minutes) - open to suggestions on easier ways to input duration
3. Streaming service

### Making a pick

Under your name is a big indigo button. Clicking the button will randomly select a movie from your pool as a pending pick. You have the options to **re-roll**, **cancel**, or **confirm** the pick.

If you confirm the pick, other members will be locked from making a pick. Selection will re-open the following day after noon.

### To-Do List

1. Add authentication, most likely Google
2. Ability to see your pool
3. Delete picks from pool
4. ????
